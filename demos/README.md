## Setup

Install the 'serve' tool

```
npm install -g serve
```


## Running

```
serve -s demos/jump
```

## Viewing
Open the following link in your browser to view the demo:

```
http://localhost:3000?apikey=your-api-key
```

By default serve will use port 3000 (as above).  If the port printed out by the ```serve -s``` commind is different use that port number instead.
