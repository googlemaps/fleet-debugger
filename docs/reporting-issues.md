# Data file

Since all the data is in the browsers local storage only, sending deep link url's is not really a feature. This would only center the map.
For this reason, if you experience an issue zip compress your cloud logging json file that reporoduces the issue.
Search and replace sensitive strings, for instance vehicle ID or trip ID before sending this file in a bug report or similar.
